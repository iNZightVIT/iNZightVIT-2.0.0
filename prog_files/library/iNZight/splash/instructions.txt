Drag a variable into the Variable 1 slot to start exploring!


Some helpful tips:

- Click on one of the Variable boxes and use the up/down arrow keys
  to step through the variables in the data set!

- Use Add to Plot (the blue bar-graph icon with a plus)
  to add a splash of colour to your graph.

- Not sure what something does? Click it and find out!
  The worst you can do is crash the program, and if that happens
  it would be super helpful to you, me, and everyone else if you
  sent off a bug report explaining what you did and what happened.
  (See the Help Menu)

- Most importantly, have fun!
