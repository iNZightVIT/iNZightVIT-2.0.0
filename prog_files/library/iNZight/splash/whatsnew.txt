A few things have changed ...

- Time travel just got cooler!
  iNZight has started learning how to handle time data! Check out the
  new menu option under "Variables > Dates and Times".

- Got more data? We'll merge that!
  From the "Dataset > Merge/Join datasets" menu, you can add more columns
  or rows from an external dataset without leaving iNZight!

- Get out your violins, we've got new plot types!
  Choose from a collection of new plot types under "Add to Plot > Plot type",
  from density plots to violin plots, column charts to pies (or donuts, if that's your thing).

- There's more, too ...
  Survey designs have been improved, as have the model fitting and time series modules.
  Check out all the changes from the "Help > Change history" menu.
