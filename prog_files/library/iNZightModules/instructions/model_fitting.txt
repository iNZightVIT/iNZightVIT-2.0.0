Response Options:
    Here, you can choose a response variable, modeling framework,
    and other model options.

Explanatory Variables:
    This is where you construct your variable by choosing variables and
    applying transformations
    - On the LEFT side you'll find variables available to use in the model,
      divided into numeric and categorical
    - On the RIGHT side is Variables of Interest (i.e., variables in the model),
      as well as Confounding Variables (variables that are necessary
      for the model, but for which the coefficients aren't of interest)

Manage Saved Models:
    After you've decided on a model, you can save it here so you can quickly
    come back to it later.
    - Saving a model will cause the R code for that model to be saved
      and viewable in R Code History

Model/Residual Plots:
    Here you can browse the avaialable residual plots etc.


GETTING STARTED

1. Select a response variable from the Variable drop down under Response Options

2. Select explanatory variables by adding them from the boxes on the left
  - Double-click variable in the numeric or categorical variables boxes to
    add them to Variables of Interest box
  - Drag-and-drop variables from the Available Variables box to either
    Variables of Interest or Confounding Variables
  - Use the up/down arrows above the Variables of Interest box to change the
    order of the selected variable

3. Apply transformations or interactions to variables
  - Right-click variables in the left-hand boxes and select a transformation
    to ADD that transformation to the model
  - Click the properties icon above the Variables of Interest box to MODIFY
    the transformation for the selected variable

4. Double-click variables in the Explanatory Variables box to remove them

5. Explore plots of the model by selecting them in the Residual Plots section

NOTE: to add transformations or interactions to confounding variables,
first drag the variable to Variables of Interset, apply the transformation,
then drag the transformed variable back to confounding.
