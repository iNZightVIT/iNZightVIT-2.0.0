GETTING AROUND

You can lay out the windows however you like. There should be three plus this one:
 - The interface: where you chose variables and graphs
 - Model Output: text/numerical summaries of fitted models are shown in this window
        (NOTE: it may be hiding underneath this instructions window)
 - Model Plots: plots for the chosen model are shown here
 - And this one: instructions - you can close this window at any time

Note: You can reopen windows from the "View" menu.
