Description: Set of function for sparse matrix algebra.
  Differences with SparseM/Matrix are: 
  (1) we only support (essentially) one sparse matrix format, 
  (2) based on transparent and simple structure(s), 
  (3) tailored for MCMC calculations within GMRF. 
  (4) S3 and S4 like-"compatible"  ...     and it is fast.
