appendPath           appends a vpPath to include the number n
                     on the bottommost viewport. If the bottom
                     most viewport ends in a number, it
                     replaces that number with n.

plotPointsAndBoxplot
                     Used for displaying numeric data. Plots a
                     group of points with a boxplot in the
                     specified viewport. The points will be
                     stacked on top of each other in an
                     intelligent manner when necessary.

stackPoints          Calculates y values for a vector of
                     overlapping x values. Y values are
                     designed to prevent overlapping by
                     creating the appearance of stacked data.
                     A helper function for numeric 1d Data.
                     Also used for 2d data where one dimension
                     is numeric, and one is categorical.
